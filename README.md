# SwingPy

> A (WIP) python package for modeling the state-space dynamics of west coast swing dance patterns.

The goal of this project is to model the dynamics of WCS patterns (using a mathematical representation called "state-space"), in order to uncover why certain combinations or stylizations of patterns are suited for musicality, as well as to generate new possible combinations of patterns.

## Background

West Coast Swing (WCS) is a style of partner-dance, danced to a variety of music (s.a. blues, country, and modern-contemporary) mostly consisting of a 4/4 time-signature. In "dance-speak", this translates to beats counted in sets of 8 (a.k.a. "8-count"), but unlike most other style of partner-dances, WCS patterns are not constrained to 8 counts - i.e., most baseline patterns consist of 6 or 8 counts, but more generally, they can be thought of as combinations of 2-count patterns. Why is this important? Most 4/4 time-signature songs, by nature, have an "accent" or "break" on the odd count of every new measure or phrase change (and sometimes in other places). Since not all patterns are inherently "accented" on their odd counts, dancers (particularly, leaders) must be mindful of the timing, combination, or stylization of patterns for adding musicality to their dance.
